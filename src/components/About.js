        <p>
          I have been a Reinsurance Operations Associate for the past 5+ years
          and continue to expand my skills in data analytics. Currently, I am
          taking a full stack developer bootcamp through The University of
          Kansas with a completion date of August 2021. Please take a look at my
          completed projects and résumé. Contact me using the email or links
          provided below for any questions or comments.
